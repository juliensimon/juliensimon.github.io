   Since 2006, Amazon Web Services (AWS) has been helping millions of customers build and manage their IT workloads. From startups to large enterprises to public sector, organizations of all sizes use our cloud computing services to reach unprecedented levels of security, resiliency, and scalability. Every day, they’re able to experiment, innovate, and deploy to production in less time and at lower cost than ever before. Thus, business opportunities can be explored, seized, and turned into industrial-grade products and services.
  </p>
  <p>
   As Machine Learning (ML) became a growing priority for our customers, they asked us to build an ML service infused with the same agility and robustness. The result was
   <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/">
    Amazon SageMaker
   </a>
   , a fully managed service
   <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM4zhNO5Rbg">
    launched
   </a>
   at AWS re:Invent 2017 that provides every developer and data scientist with the ability to build, train, and deploy ML models quickly.
  </p>
  <p>
   <a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2020/10/01/SageMaker_Overview-Chart.247eaea6e41ddca8299c5a9a9e91b5d78b751c38.png">

   </a>
  </p>
  <p>
   Today,
   <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/">
    Amazon SageMaker
   </a>
   is helping tens of thousands of
   <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/customers/">
    customers
   </a>
   in all industry segments build, train and deploy high quality models in production: financial services (Euler Hermes, Intuit, Slice Labs, Nerdwallet, Root Insurance, Coinbase, NuData Security, Siemens Financial Services), healthcare (GE Healthcare, Cerner, Roche, Celgene, Zocdoc), news and media (Dow Jones, Thomson Reuters, ProQuest, SmartNews, Frame.io, Sportograf), sports (Formula 1, Bundesliga, Olympique de Marseille, NFL, Guiness Six Nations Rugby), retail (Zalando, Zappos, Fabulyst), automotive (Atlas Van Lines, Edmunds, Regit), dating (Tinder), hospitality (Hotels.com, iFood), industry and manufacturing (Veolia, Formosa Plastics), gaming (Voodoo), customer relationship management (Zendesk, Freshworks), energy (Kinect Energy Group, Advanced Microgrid Systems), real estate (Realtor.com), satellite imagery (Digital Globe), human resources (ADP), and many more.
  </p>
  <p>
   When we asked our customers why they decided to standardize their ML workloads on
   <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/">
    Amazon SageMaker
   </a>
   , the most common answer was: “
   <em>
    SageMaker removes the undifferentiated heavy lifting from each step of the ML process.
   </em>
   ” Zooming in, we identified five areas where SageMaker helps them most.
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">
     #1 – Build Secure and Reliable ML Models, Faster
     <br/>
    </span>
   </strong>
   As many ML models are used to serve real-time predictions to business applications and end users, making sure that they stay available and fast is of paramount importance. This is why
   <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/">
    Amazon SageMaker
   </a>
   endpoints have built-in support for load balancing across multiple AWS Availability Zones, as well as built-in
   <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/load-test-and-optimize-an-amazon-sagemaker-endpoint-using-automatic-scaling/">
    Auto Scaling
   </a>
   to dynamically adjust the number of provisioned instances according to incoming traffic.
  </p>
  <p>
   For even more robustness and scalability,
   <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/">
    Amazon SageMaker
   </a>
   relies on production-grade open source model servers such as
   <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/performing-batch-inference-with-tensorflow-serving-in-amazon-sagemaker/">
    TensorFlow Serving
   </a>
   , the
   <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/introducing-model-server-for-apache-mxnet/">
    Multi-Model Server
   </a>
   , and
   <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/announcing-torchserve-an-open-source-model-server-for-pytorch/">
    TorchServe
   </a>
   . A collaboration between AWS and Facebook, TorchServe is available as part of the
   <a href="https://pytorch.org/">
    PyTorch
   </a>
   project, and makes it easy to deploy trained models at scale without having to write custom code.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition to resilient infrastructure and scalable model serving, you can also rely on
   <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-sagemaker-model-monitor-fully-managed-automatic-monitoring-for-your-machine-learning-models/">
    Amazon SageMaker Model Monitor
   </a>
   to catch prediction quality issues that could happen on your endpoints. By saving incoming requests as well as outgoing predictions, and by comparing them to a baseline built from a training set, you can quickly identify and fix problems like missing features or data drift.

      <em>
       In 8 short weeks, we worked with AWS to develop a prototype that anticipates when to clean or change water filtering membranes in our desalination plants. Using Amazon SageMaker, we built a ML model that learns from previous patterns and predicts the future evolution of fouling indicators. By standardizing our ML workloads on AWS, we were able to reduce costs and prevent downtime while improving the quality of the water produced. These results couldn’t have been realized without the technical experience, trust, and dedication of both teams to achieve one goal: an uninterrupted clean and safe water supply.

   </a>
   (TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Apache MXNet), or
   <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/docker-containers-adapt-your-own.html">
    your own custom code
   </a>
   packaged in a Docker container.
  </p>
  <p>
   You could also rely on
   <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-sagemaker-autopilot-fully-managed-automatic-machine-learning/">

SageMaker Autopilot also now creates machine learning models up to
   <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/10/amazon-sagemaker-autopilot-creates-machine-learning-models-faster-higher-accuracy/">
    40% faster with up to 200% higher accuracy
   </a>
   , even with small and imbalanced datasets.
  </p>
  <p>
   Another popular feature is
   <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/amazon-sagemaker-automatic-model-tuning-now-supports-random-search-and-hyperparameter-scaling/">

     #3 – Reduce Costs
    </strong>
   </span>
   <br/>
   Building and managing your own ML infrastructure can be costly, and
   <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/">
    Amazon SageMaker
   </a>
   is a great alternative. In fact, we found out that the total cost of ownership (TCO) of
   <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/">
    Amazon SageMaker
   </a>
   over a 3-year horizon is over
   <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/lowering-total-cost-of-ownership-for-machine-learning-and-increasing-productivity-with-amazon-sagemaker/">
    54% lower compared to other options
   </a>
   , and developers can be up to 10 times more productive. This comes from the fact that
   <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/">
    Amazon SageMaker
   </a>
   manages all the training and prediction infrastructure that ML typically requires, allowing teams to focus exclusively on studying and solving the ML problem at hand.
  </p>
  <p>
   Furthermore,
   <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/">
    Amazon SageMaker
   </a>
   includes many features that help training jobs run as fast and as cost-effectively as possible: optimized versions of the most popular
   <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/frameworks.html">
    machine learning libraries
   </a>
   , a wide range of

    Amazon SageMaker Debugger
   </a>
   automatically identifies complex issues developing in ML training jobs. Unproductive jobs are terminated early, and you can use model information captured during training to pinpoint the root cause.
  </p>
  <p>
   <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/">

   </a>
   also helps you slash your prediction costs. Thanks to

    Multi-Model Endpoints
   </a>
