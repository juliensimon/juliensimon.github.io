  <p>
   Today, I’m extremely happy to announce
   <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/feature-store/">
    Amazon SageMaker Feature Store
   </a>
   , a new capability of
   <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/">
    Amazon SageMaker
   </a>
   that makes it easy for data scientists and machine learning engineers to securely store, discover and share curated data used in training and prediction workflows.
  </p>
  <p>
   For all the importance of selecting the right algorithm to train machine learning (ML) models, experienced practitioners know how crucial it is to feed it with high-quality data. Cleaning data is a good first step, and ML workflows routinely include steps to fill missing values, remove outliers, and so on. Then, they often move on to transforming data, using a mix of common and arcane techniques known as “feature engineering.”
  </p>
  <p>
   Simply put, the purpose of feature engineering is to transform your data and to increase its expressiveness so that the algorithm may learn better. For instance, many columnar datasets include strings, such as street addresses. To most ML algorithms, strings are meaningless, and they need to be encoded in a numerical representation. Thus, you could replace street addresses with GPS coordinates, a much more expressive way to learn the concept of location. In other words, if data is the new oil, then feature engineering is the refining process that turns it into high-octane jet fuel that helps models get to stratospheric accuracy.
  </p>
  <p>
   Indeed, ML practitioners spend a lot of time crafting feature engineering code, applying it to their initial datasets, training models on the engineered datasets, and evaluating model accuracy. Given the experimental nature of this work, even the smallest project will lead to multiple iterations. The same feature engineering code is often run again and again, wasting time and compute resources on repeating the same operations. In large organizations, this can cause an even greater loss of productivity, as different teams often run identical jobs, or even write duplicate feature engineering code because they have no knowledge of prior work.
  </p>
  <p>
   There’s another hard problem that ML teams have to solve. As models are trained on engineered datasets, it’s imperative to apply the same transformations to data sent for prediction. This often means rewriting feature engineering code, sometimes in a different language, integrating it in your prediction workflow, and running it at prediction time. This whole process is not only time-consuming, it can also introduce inconsistencies, as even the tiniest variation in a data transform can have a large impact on predictions.
  </p>
  <p>
   In order to solve these problems, ML teams sometimes build a feature store, a central repository where they can keep and retrieve engineered data used in their training and predictions jobs. As useful as feature stores are, building and managing your own involves a lot of engineering, infrastructure, and operational effort that takes valuable time away from actual ML work. Customers asked us for a better solution, and we got to work.

     Introducing Amazon SageMaker Feature Store
    </span>
   </strong>
   <br/>
   <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/feature-store/">
    Amazon SageMaker Feature Store
   </a>
   is a fully managed centralized repository for your ML features, making it easy to securely store and retrieve features without having to manage any infrastructure. It’s part of
   <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/">
    Amazon SageMaker
   </a>
   , our fully managed service for ML, and supports all algorithms. It’s also integrated with
   <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/studio">
    Amazon SageMaker Studio
   </a>
   , our web-based development environment for ML.
  </p>
  <p>
   Features stored in
   <span title="Amazon SageMaker Feature Store">
    SageMaker Feature Store
   </span>
   are organized in groups, and tagged with metadata. Thanks to this, you can quickly discover which features are available, and whether they’re suitable for your models. Multiple teams can also easily share and re-use features, reducing the cost of development and accelerating innovation.
  </p>
  <p>
   Once stored, features can be retrieved and used in your
   <span title="Amazon SageMaker">
    SageMaker
   </span>
   workflows: model training, batch transform, and real-time prediction with low latency. Not only do you avoid duplicating work, you also build consistent workflows that use the same consistent features stored in the offline and online stores.

   Now, let’s see how you can get started.

    <strong>
     Storing and Retrieving Features with Amazon SageMaker Feature Store
     <br/>
    </strong>
   </span>
   Once you’ve run your feature engineering code on your data, you can organize and store your engineered features in
   <span title="Amazon SageMaker Feature Store">
    SageMaker Feature Store
   </span>
   , by grouping them in feature groups. A feature group is a collection of records, similar to rows in a table. Each record has a unique identifier, and holds the engineered feature values for one of the data instances in your original data source. Optionally, you can choose to encrypt the data at rest using your own
   <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/kms/">
    AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS)
   </a>
   key that is unique for each feature group.
  </p>
  <p>
   How you define feature groups is up to you. For example, you could create one per data source (CSV files, database tables, and so on), and use a convenient unique column as the record identifier (primary key, customer id, transaction id, and so on).
  </p>
  <p>
   Once you’ve got your groups figured out, you should repeat the following steps for each group:
  </p>
  <ol>
   <li>
    Create feature definitions, with the name and the type of each feature in a record (

     Integral
    </code>
    , or
    <code>
     String
    </code>
    ).
   </li>
   <li>
    Create each feature group with the
    <code>
     create_feature_group()
    </code>
    API:
    <pre><code class="lang-python">sm_feature_store.create_feature_group(
     # The name of the feature group
     FeatureGroupName=my_feature_group_name,
     # The name of the column acting as the record identifier
     RecordIdentifierName=record_identifier_name,
     # The name of the column action as the feature timestamp
     EventTimeFeatureName = event_time_feature_name,
     # A list of feature names and types
     FeatureDefinitions=my_feature_definitions,
     # The S3 location for the offline feature store
     OfflineStoreConfig=offline_store_config,
     # Optionally, enable the online feature store
     OnlineStoreConfig=online_store_config,
     # An IAM role
     RoleArn=role
)</code></pre>
   </li>
   <li>
    In each feature group, store records containing a collection of feature name/feature value pairs, using the
    <code>
     put_record()
    </code>
    API:
    <pre><code class="lang-python">sm_feature_store.put_record(
   FeatureGroupName=feature_group_name,
   Record=record,
   EventTime=event_time
)</code></pre>
    <p>
     For faster ingestion, you could create multiple threads and parallelize this operation.
    </p>
   </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
   At this point, features will be available in
   <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/feature-store/">
    Amazon SageMaker Feature Store
   </a>
   . Thanks to the offline store, you can use services such as
   <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/athena">
    Amazon Athena
   </a>
   ,
   <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/glue/">
    AWS Glue
   </a>
   , or
   <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/emr">
    Amazon EMR
   </a>
   to build datasets for training: fetch the corresponding JSON objects in S3, select the features that you need, and save them in S3 in the format expected by your ML algorithm. From then on, it’s SageMaker business as usual!
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition, you can use the
   <code>
    get_record()
   </code>
   API to access individual records stored in the online store, passing the group name and the unique identifier of the record you want to access, like so:
  </p>
  <pre><code class="lang-python">record = sm_feature_store.get_record(
    FeatureGroupName=my_feature_group_name,
    RecordIdentifierValue={"IntegralValue": 5962}
)</code></pre>
  <p>
   <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/feature-store/">
    Amazon SageMaker Feature Store
   </a>
   is designed for fast and efficient access for real time inference, with a P95 latency lower than 10ms for a 15-kilobyte payload. This makes it possible to query for engineered features at prediction time, and to replace raw features sent by the upstream application with the exact same features used to train the model. Feature inconsistencies are eliminated by design, letting you focus on building the best models instead of chasing bugs.
  </p>
  <p>
   Finally, as
   <span title="Amazon SageMaker Feature Store">
    SageMaker Feature Store
   </span>
   includes feature creation timestamps, you can retrieve the state of your features at a particular point in time.
  </p>
  <p>
   As
   <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/feature-store/">
    Amazon SageMaker Feature Store
   </a>
   is integrated with
   <span title="Amazon SageMaker Studio">
    SageMaker Studio
   </span>
   , I can see my two features groups there.
  </p>
  <p>

   </a>
  </p>
  <p>
   Right-clicking on “Open feature group detail”, I open the identity feature group.
  </p>
  <p>
   <img alt="SageMaker screenshot" class="size-full wp-image-44357 aligncenter" height="559" loading="lazy" src="image02.webp" width="828"/>
  </p>
  <p>
   I can see feature definitions.

  <p>

  </p>
  <p>
   Finally, I can generate queries for the offline store, which I could add to a
   <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/data-wrangler">
    Amazon SageMaker Data Wrangler
   </a>
   workflow to load features prior to training.
  </p>
  <p>
