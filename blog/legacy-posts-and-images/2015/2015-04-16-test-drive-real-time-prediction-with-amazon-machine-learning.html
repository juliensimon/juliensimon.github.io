As explained in my <a href="#image-not-found" target="_blank">previous article</a>, Amazon ML supports both batch prediction and real-time prediction.<br />
<br />
I burned some rubber (and some cash!) on batch prediction, but there's still some gas in the tank and tires ain't totally dead yet, so let's do a few more laps and see how the real-time thing works :)<br />
<br />
Assuming you've already built and evaluated a model, one single operation is required to perform real-time prediction: create a real-time endpoint, i.e. a web service URL to send your requests to.<br />
<br />
Of course, we could to this in the AWS console, but why not use the CLI instead?&nbsp; A word of warning: at the time of writing, the CLI package available from the AWS website suffers from a nasty bug on prediction calls (see <a href="https://forums.aws.amazon.com/thread.jspa?messageID=615018">https://forums.aws.amazon.com/thread.jspa?messageID=615018</a>). You'll need to download and install the latest version from Github:<br />
<br />
<script src="https://gist.github.com/juliensimon/050948f43d42894ccc41.js"></script>

While we're at it, let's take a quick look at the CLI for Amazon ML. Here's our model, built from 100,000 lines with the format described in my previous article:<br />
<br />
<script src="https://gist.github.com/juliensimon/1b3bad080dda5fba87c1.js"></script>

Let's also look at the evaluation for this model. The log file URL gives away the fact Amazon ML jobs are based on EMR... in case you had any doubts ;)<br />
&nbsp;<script src="https://gist.github.com/juliensimon/932740ca93c55a175a60.js"></script>

All right, everything looks good. Time to create a prediction endpoint for our model:<br />
<br />
<script src="https://gist.github.com/juliensimon/e5122d8f0b249a0f601a.js"></script>

Pretty simple. We can now see that our model is accessible at <i>https://realtime.machinelearning.us-east-1.amazonaws.com</i><br />
<br />
<script src="https://gist.github.com/juliensimon/730b6e69f7548d559df9.js"></script>

And now, the moment of truth: let's hit the endpoint with a record.<br />
<br />
<script src="https://gist.github.com/juliensimon/1b76c384ea6bd187bb72.js"></script>

Boom. We got a predicted value. This actually worked on the first call, I guess caffeine was stronger this morning ;)<br />
<br />
One last question for today: how fast is this baby? I tested two different setups :<br />
<ul>
<li>Return trip between my office in Paris and the endpoint in <i>us-east-1 </i>: about 700 ms</li>
<li>Return trip between an EC2 instance in <i>us-east-1</i> and the endpoint in <i>us-east-1 </i>: about 300 ms</li>
</ul>
<br />
<script src="https://gist.github.com/juliensimon/17f9cc88a3c0f70725b6.js"></script>

(<i>and yes, I did run the tests multiple times. These numbers are average values</i>).<br />
<br />
Slower than expected. The <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/fr/machine-learning/faqs/" target="_blank">Amazon ML FAQ</a> says: <br />
<br />
<i><b>Q: How fast can the Amazon Machine Learning real-time API generate predictions?</b></i><br />
<i> 
          Most real-time prediction requests return a response within
 100 MS, making them fast enough for interactive web, mobile, or desktop
 applications. The exact time it takes for the real-time API to generate
 a prediction varies depending on the size of the input data record, and
 the complexity of the data processing “recipe” associated with the ML 
model that is generating the predictions</i><br />
<br />
300 ms feels slow, especially since my model doesn't strike me as super-complicated. Maybe I'm jaded ;)<br />
<br />
Ok, enough bitching :) This product has only been out a week or so and it's already fuckin' AWESOME. It's hard to believe Amazon made ML this simple. If I can get this to work, anyone can.<br />
<br />
Given the right level of price, performance and scale (all will come quickly), I see this product&nbsp; crushing the competition... and not only other ML SaaS providers. Hardware & software vendors should start sweating even more than they already do.<br />
<br />
C'mon, give this thing a try and tell me you're STILL eager to build Hadoop clusters and write Map-Reduce jobs. Seriously?<br />
<br />
Till next time, keep rockin'.
