<div style="text-align: justify;">
Skills, attitude, stamina: the iron triangle of survival in challenging environments.</div>
<div class="p2" style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div class="p1" style="text-align: justify;">
No skills? You're dead weight, no one will ever want you on their team. Rusty or outdated skills? If you're lucky, you may get a job maintaining legacy systems… until they're shut down or outsourced. Bottom line: if you think you were done learning when you left school, think again. You should never stop learning: blogs, books, personal projects, conferences, anything goes. Don't let your edge grow dull, keep it razor sharp.</div>
<div class="p2" style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div class="p1" style="text-align: justify;">
Example: 40-year old embedded software engineer who decides in 2001 that he doesn't like object-oriented languages and that he will keep writing assembly and C language for the rest of his life. Fast forward 5 years: ALL projects now include embedded Java applications, which junior engineers can write and debug with their eyes closed (for half the salary). Game over. The guy barely saves his ass by accepting Quality & Documentation tasks: not what he had in mind, but still useful and way better than being out of a job at 45 with two kids.</div>
<div class="p2" style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div class="p2" style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div class="p1" style="text-align: justify;">
Poor attitude? You might fool the team for a while, but you'll end up being thrown overboard. You need to truly believe in what you're doing and give it your best shot. It has to be more than "just a job". No, this isn't about lapping up corporate bullshit ("work hard, have fun", you know what I mean). It's about standing your ground, soldiering on, delivering the goods, being someone that your buddies can count on in good and bad times alike. Ask yourself: when the time comes to leave, will I be able to look proudly at what I've helped build over the years? Two years later, will I be remembered as the tough-as-nails engineer who got shit done, no matter what? Will my code still run in production? Yes? Job done then, with plenty of good memories and war stories to share. Nothing else matters.</div>
<div class="p2" style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div class="p1" style="text-align: justify;">
Example: that last guy who joined, left after 6 months and that no one remotely remembers. Which is the way it should be.</div>
<div class="p2" style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div class="p2" style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div class="p1" style="text-align: justify;">
No stamina? You might be the sharpest, nicest guy around but you won't last. It's not about long hours, nights or weekends (yes, they're sometimes needed). It's about enduring the daily insanity of fast-paced projects: 180-degree turns, showstopping bugs 2 days before the release, supplier issues, customer whims, management stupidity… The list is endless. If you blow a fuse at every roadblock, you're bound to waste energy, grow tired and lose motivation, so whatever you need to do to vent off, do it regularly. Also, never ever lose your sense of humor: unless your code runs in nuclear plants, airplanes or hospital life-support systems, &nbsp;it can't be THAT bad, so stop being a miserable bastard and just try to laugh it off&nbsp;(even if it's damn hard sometimes).&nbsp;Remember: it's not a sprint, it's a marathon, a 40-year long marathon. You won't make it without nerves of steel and a healthy dose of self-derision.</div>
<div class="p2" style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div class="p1" style="text-align: justify;">
Example: the burnt-out, negative, cynical guy in your team who used to be a super achiever and a great guy. Do him a favor and let him go.</div>
<div class="p1" style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div class="p1" style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div class="p1" style="text-align: justify;">
Bottom line: it all starts or ends with you. Take care of yourself, but keep pushing your own envelope. Don't&nbsp;pretend, do it for real: the more you sweat in training, the less you bleed in combat.</div>
<div class="p1" style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div class="p1" style="text-align: justify;">
