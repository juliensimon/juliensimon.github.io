<div class="description">Exploring the complexities of bias in AI models reveals how creator decisions shape the alignment and performance of these systems. Even the most advanced models can fall victim to alignment flaws driven by a lack of diversity in the workforce responsible for their training. As creators curate datasets and write prompts, the potential for unintended biases increases, leading to troubling outcomes that can be both blatant and subtle. This digital discourse dives deep into the nuances of this pressing issue, highlighting the importance of diverse perspectives in the AI development process to combat these inherent risks. Gain insight into why addressing bias isn’t just beneficial but essential for the future of technology.</div>

<h2>Transcript</h2>
            You don't know how they've been aligned. That's the thing. No names, but all those closed models have amazing capabilities. Some I like more than others, but it doesn't matter which ones. Their creators have decided for you. They have curated the data set, designed the alignment process, and written the prompts and system prompts. If that works for you, great; it'll save you time. However, it might stand in the way, or sometimes it just becomes extremely stupid. We saw a closed model from another company generate historically incorrect figures. It was good fun to watch, and it was pretty obvious those were wrong. But the problem is, it could be more subtle.

The human element is crucial. The devil is in the details. Everyone wants to fight bias and have safe models. But if the workforce that aligns the model is not diverse enough, ironically, if all those people think the same, they are introducing another bias into the model. So, it is a complex problem. The road to hell is paved with good intentions. Bias, risk, and alignment are all tricky.
