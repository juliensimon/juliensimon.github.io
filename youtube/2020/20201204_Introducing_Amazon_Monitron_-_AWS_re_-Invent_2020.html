<h2>Transcript</h2>
            Hi everybody, this is Julien from Arcee. In this video, I would like to introduce you to Amazon Monitron, a new service that we just launched at AWS Reinvent. Amazon Monitron is an end-to-end system for equipment monitoring, making it easy for reliability managers and technicians to build predictive maintenance applications. Essentially, we're trying to predict when industrial equipment is going to fail. Monitron does this by allowing you to deploy sensors—let me show you one of these—and attach them to your equipment. We even provide you with stickers. Attach those, and they come in a starter kit with five sensors, with additional packs available for order. These sensors use Bluetooth low energy to send vibration and temperature information to the Monitron gateway.

Here it is. The only thing you need to do is give it some power. We have a power adapter for this, including an EU socket, which is critical for me. Plug this in, set it up, and your sensors will start sending data to the gateway. The gateway connects to your local Wi-Fi network and sends that data to the AWS cloud, where it's stored and analyzed. Using machine learning models, we detect developing conditions and send alerts visible in a mobile app. Technicians can use this app to see temperature and vibration graphs, a list of alerts, and inspect equipment to ensure any issues are addressed.

This is super simple, and I can show you quickly how to do this. This is the blog post I wrote, and I'll put the URL in the video description. First, press the button on the gateway. There's a button here. Press this and enable Bluetooth on your phone. You will see the gateway showing up immediately, connect to it, and enter the Wi-Fi credentials for the gateway to connect to your Wi-Fi network. Using the mobile app, you can create a site. Maybe you're managing multiple sites, factories, or warehouses, so you can organize this very nicely. In each site, you can start adding gateways. You can see my gateway has been added here, it's online, and it's connected to AWS. Then, you can start adding assets—pieces of equipment you want to monitor. Create them, give them a name, and define their ISO 2816 class, which is a standard for measurement and evaluation of machine vibration. It has different classes for various equipment types, so find the right one. Then, you can add a sensor. Grab one, enable NFC on your phone, and apply the phone to the sensor to pair it within seconds. It will say "healthy," meaning the sensor is talking to the gateway and the gateway is talking to AWS. Do this a few times, use the sticker tape to attach the sensor to your equipment, and repeat as needed. Within a few minutes, you'll see graphs. There's not much on this one because I did this demo in real time. But you can see for this specific sensor, we have a temperature graph and a vibration graph. Over time, you will see more information. If the machine learning models detect issues, such as gradually increasing vibration or temperature, you'll get an alert. You can see there's an alert notification in the app, and you can go inspect your equipment.

You can get started using the starter kit, which comes in a box, and you can buy more sensors as needed. If you want to get started, go to the AWS console for Monitron. As it says here, you can start installing devices and monitoring on December 7th. You have a few days to read about this, check out the blog post, and feel free to get in touch with any questions. This is a really interesting service, and I'm sure you will put it to good use. That's what I wanted to tell you today. Have fun with reInvent; it's still going until December 18th. If you haven't registered, go and register. It's free, and there's a ton of content to learn from. Have a great day, and I'll see you soon with more videos. Bye-bye!
