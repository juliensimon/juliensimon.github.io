<h2>Transcript</h2>
            Hi everybody. In this video, I would like to show you how to share notebooks with SageMaker Studio. Here, I logged into Studio with one of my users. I cloned the repo and opened the notebook. It's a simple scikit-learn notebook, which will be just fine for our demo. So let's just run all the cells.

Now, let's say we want to share those results with someone on the team and get them to look at the code, metrics, etc. I can save that notebook locally and then just click on share in the top right corner. Since this notebook comes from a cloned repo, I can include the name of the repo for reference and include the output because I want my colleague to see it. So I just click on create and immediately I get a link to the notebook. I just copy the link and would send this link to the person I want to share it with.

Here, I have another browser with a private session and a different user. This is not the same user that I used to run the notebook. So, somebody sent me that link, and I can just open a tab here, copy the link, and this will open the snapshot that the previous user created. All right, here it comes. I get a read-only preview, so if I just need to take a quick look, there's nothing else to do. Or if I want to run that notebook myself, then I can just click on Create a Copy. This creates a local read-write copy of the notebook. Then, of course, I could run it myself and try to see if I can tweak those results and get better accuracy, etc.

So, super simple, much simpler than having to commit your notebook to a repo. Plus, this is really just a temporary thing. There's no reason to actually commit it. You could also download it and send it, but then you have to send the file, etc. All kinds of problems can happen there. So this is just a one-click way to share a notebook with anybody in your organization. And I think it's pretty simple. That's it for today. Thank you for listening.
