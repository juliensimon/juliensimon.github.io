            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            Hello! Hi everybody! I'm Julien, I'm the evangelist for MEA, and we have Adrian today. Hey, I'm the evangelist for the Nordic region. Yeah, two evangelists for the price of one. We'd like to take a few minutes to talk about a new exciting event called Dev Days or Builder's Day in the UK. So Adrian, tell us about that.

Dev Days are events that address one particular need we found last year and in previous years: addressing AWS users and customers that already use AWS and want to go deep into specific topics. Dev Days are full-day events with three tracks: containers, serverless, and AI, with five sessions per track. We also include some workshops. For example, we started the Dev Days this year in the Nordics with Stockholm and Helsinki, offering workshops on serverless and mobile development. The evangelist team flew in to deliver the talks.

Who should come to Dev Days? Who did we really build this for? The content is very technical, so it's ideal for people who want to deepen their understanding of services, architectures, and building on AWS. It's also great for those who generally love technical content. Most sessions are delivered by evangelists, with some specialist sessions as well. You can expect a lot of code, demos, and some slides to introduce concepts. The purpose is to go deep, show you how it really works, and help you get started. We do live demos, which can be risky, but we like to live dangerously.

The feedback from customers after the Dev Days in the Nordics was really good. Even customers just starting their AWS journey loved the inspiration they could take from it, although some found the AI content overwhelming. If you're a developer, you're used to learning new stuff, so you'll figure it out. I'd definitely suggest it to anyone who is a developer interested in going under the hood with AWS.

Let's talk about the agenda. We had sessions on serverless, containers, and AI, with five sessions per track. The day starts with a state of the union for each track, then progressively delves deeper into technical details. For serverless, we had Danilo, myself, Abbie, and Paul Maddox. Abbie flew from the US to talk about containers, ECS, EKS, Fargate, etc. Ian Massigan and Jan worked on the AI track. As you can see, it's a lot of evangelists in one place, which means a lot of code, demos, fun, and questions to be answered.

When are the next ones? They've been so successful that people are really filling up our calendars. We're launching Dev Days in the Netherlands on March 20. We'll have some in Germany soon, and we're planning four days in Germany. Next week, we have Edinburgh, Manchester, and Dublin in the UK.

Here's your call to action. If you'd like to have a Dev Day in your city or country, we'd love to be there. We love to travel and meet you and answer your questions. Get in touch with your AWS local team and ask them to organize it. If enough people request it, we'll come to your city and deliver the same content and help you answer your questions. Ask for it. We'll do it.

All right. Thank you, Adrian. See you soon. Yeah, we'll be there. We'll go anywhere. Take care. Bye-bye. See you. Bye-bye.
