<h2>Transcript</h2>
            Hey, hi everybody. This is Julien from Arcee, and I've got something a little different today. We're not really going to talk about machine learning. I'm going to show you what you get when you have a deep eraser in a box like this. By the way, I'm wearing glasses now, so you can make fun of me getting old, I guess. This is the box. Thank you very much, Sally, for giving this to me when I was in Seattle last time. Sorry, I had to crush the box to make it fit in my suitcase, so it looks a bit rough. Let's open it and see what's inside.

Alright, so what's in the box? There's a car and batteries, and no one reads documentation anyway. Ok, this is a battery pack. And, of course, I've thrown away all the plastic already, so yours will be nicely packaged, mine is a mess. Here’s the battery pack, charger, and the power cable for the charger. Mine is a US adapter, but hopefully, we'll be able to bring the right adapter to the right people. This is the cable for the power bank to power the car, which is useful. We also have another battery and a charger. The one I got in Seattle was missing this, so this actually comes from Amazon. If you need to buy extra, they run out, you need 7.4 volts, 1100 milliamps per hour. The one you get in the box might be a little different. I got this and two batteries for 20 bucks or something. You might get that if you want to.

We have a car. Let's try it out and see if we can break it. Oh, and extra pins because we're going to lose all those things. You want to see what's inside? I might give it a nice paint job, you know, flames and skulls. We'll see about that. This is probably the front of the car, and this looks like a deep lens. Where's my deep lens? Oh, looks like they got creative and reused. We have extra USB plugs, and we'll see what they're for later. There are all kinds of plugs and HDMI connectors. I have no idea what they're for, but I guess I'll find out. There's the power button, a reset button, and I should be able to fit these somewhere. This is the car battery, so it fits somewhere in there. I guess I'll find out later. And this is the compute module battery, which runs your prediction when the car is trying to stay on track. We need to charge both battery packs.

Let's take a closer look. Here’s the front, the other side, and the back. If I remove those extra pins, I wasn't planning to do this, but I'm getting warmed up now. This is probably where to fit those battery packs, so I need to read the documentation a little bit. I can figure that out. Now it's time to load the packs. While that takes place, I can read the documentation and hopefully get to work on this.

If you're interested in DeepRacer, you don't really need a car to get started. If you have a car, good for you. We also need a track, which is probably something I need to build over the weekend. If you don't have a car or don't want to buy one, you can take part in the DeepRacer virtual league. You can compete by using a virtual car that you train inside the AWS console. Just go to aws.amazon.com/deepracer. You can start training a model in minutes, see the virtual car driving around the track, and compete in the virtual league. If you want to get a car and have fun with it, then do that. But again, you don't need a car to compete and have fun with DeepRacer.

So, a bunch of new toys to play with. The most important part is stickers. I have a whole bunch of them. I have hundreds. I have this one, which is pretty cool, and this one, which is very nice too. A bumper sticker. I'll carry these around. If you see me on the road in the next few weeks, please come and say hi. Chances are I will have DeepRacer stickers in my bag. I'm more than happy to get rid of all of them because I have a whole lot. Anyway, that's it for today. I have to try to put this thing back together. Hopefully, I'll be able to do that, charge the battery packs, and maybe start training models and powering up everything. Who knows where this will take us? Thanks for listening. Hope this was fun. AWS.amazon.com/deepracer. Get started. Go and race. See you next time. Bye-bye.
