<p>The Big Five tech companies plan to spend roughly $700 billion on AI infrastructure in 2026 alone. Cumulative hyperscaler AI capex from 2024 through 2029 is on track to reach $2.5 to $3 trillion. That’s more than the GDP of Canada.</p><img src="image-01.webp"/><p>History offers a clear pattern for what happens next: the builders of transformative infrastructure almost never capture most of the value they create. Railroads, fiber optic networks, and the electrical grid all followed the same arc — overbuilding, financial ruin for investors, and an eventual bonanza for the companies clever enough to ride cheap infrastructure they didn’t pay for. The question consuming investors right now is whether the AI buildout will follow this script, or whether the hyperscalers have found a structural escape from the builder’s curse.</p><h2>The capex numbers have blown past every estimate</h2><p>Alphabet just raised $32 billion across three currencies in under 24 hours — the largest single bond sale in tech history, drawing over $100 billion in orders for the dollar tranches alone. The sterling tranche included a 100-year note, the first century bond by a technology company since Motorola in 1997. I wrote about the<a href="https://www.airealist.ai/p/alphabets-100-year-bond">Alphabet century bond in detail here</a>. For this piece, the signal that matters is why: Alphabet guided for $175–185 billion in 2026 capital expenditures, nearly double 2025, and even $126 billion in cash isn’t enough to self-fund that pace. Pivotal Research projects free cash flow will plummet roughly 90%, from $73.3 billion in 2025 to just $8.2 billion in 2026. As Wedbush’s Dan Ives put it: “They’re essentially building new cities.”</p><p>Alphabet is not alone. The commonly cited “$1.5 trillion over five years” figure for AI infrastructure spending is already outdated. Based on Q4 2025 earnings guidance, the Big Five (Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, Meta, Oracle) are on pace for that $700 billion in 2026. Consensus estimates have been too low for two consecutive years.</p><p>Amazon announced $200 billion in 2026 capex — well above the $147 billion consensus. Meta guided for $115–135 billion, up from $72 billion in 2025. Microsoft’s calendar-year 2026 spend is tracking toward $145–150 billion. Oracle raised its guidance to $50 billion from $35 billion, prompting Barclays to warn the company may run out of cash by November 2026.</p><p>Capital intensity ratios tell the story: Meta is spending 55% of revenue on capex, Alphabet is approaching 45%, and Oracle has hit 57% — numbers that would be extraordinary for utilities, let alone software companies. Bank of America estimates hyperscaler capex will consume 94% of operating cash flows in 2025–2026, forcing these companies into debt markets at unprecedented scale. Morgan Stanley projects hyperscaler bond issuance will reach $400 billion in 2026, up from $165 billion in 2025.</p><p>Goldman Sachs estimates AI capex currently runs at roughly 0.8% of U.S. GDP. Prior technology booms peaked at 1.5% or higher — meaning the hyperscalers would need to hit $700 billion in 2026 just to match the telecom bubble’s peak. They appear to be on track. Only the railroad boom of the 1880s, at roughly 6% of GDP, was larger as a share of the economy.</p><h2>The telecom bubble wrote this playbook in blood</h2><p>Between 1996 and 2001, telecom companies invested more than $500 billion building fiber optic networks, financed overwhelmingly with debt. The industry accumulated over $1 trillion in total obligations. Then 23 major telecom companies filed for bankruptcy by mid-2002, destroying $2 to $2.8 trillion in stock market value. WorldCom, once valued at $180 billion, went from blue chip to nine cents a share. Nortel Networks peaked at $400 billion in market capitalization — 38% of the entire Toronto Stock Exchange — then lost 99% of its value. Half a million workers lost their jobs. The NASDAQ telecom index fell 92%.</p><p>The physical infrastructure survived. By 2002, close to 40 million miles of fiber optic cable had been buried across America, but only 2.7% was actually in use. Bandwidth prices collapsed by 90%. And this created the precise conditions for a massive value transfer. Google placed data centers wherever land and power were cheapest, connected by dirt-cheap fiber. Netflix launched streaming in 2007 atop infrastructure it never built. Amazon Web Services assembled its cloud empire from colocation facilities at fire-sale prices. The infrastructure got used — just under new ownership, at pennies on the dollar. The tech companies built on those ruins now hold market caps exceeding $10 trillion.</p><h2>Railroads and electricity confirm the pattern across centuries</h2><p>The telecom bubble was not an anomaly. During the railroad boom, approximately $8 billion was invested in U.S. rail infrastructure by 1890 — roughly 6% of GDP, with railroad stocks representing 60% of the stock market. Then one-third of all railroad mileage passed through bankruptcy in the Panic of 1893. The Becker Friedman Institute at the University of Chicago quantified what happened next: the railroad investment generated a 43% annual social rate of return, boosting U.S. productivity by 25%. But the railroads captured only 8% of that return. Standard Oil leveraged cheap rail transport to control 90% of American refining. Sears and Roebuck used the network to build the Amazon of its era. The people who built the infrastructure received almost none of the benefit.</p><p>Electrification followed the same arc. Samuel Insull built a utility empire spanning 85 corporations across 32 states, controlling $2.5 billion in assets with leverage ratios approaching 20:1. When the Depression hit, his empire collapsed. Six hundred thousand shareholders were wiped out. He died in 1938 with 84 cents in his pocket. But the electrical grid he built transformed manufacturing — electricity’s share of industrial power went from 10% in 1900 to 80% by 1930 — and the real beneficiaries were companies like Ford that used cheap power to reinvent production. The productivity gains arrived 20–30 years after the initial investment, a lag with direct implications for AI.</p><h2>This time, the application layer is also getting destroyed</h2><p>If the historical pattern holds — infrastructure builders suffer while application companies thrive — then traditional software companies should be the obvious beneficiaries of cheap AI compute. Instead, SaaS companies are experiencing what Jefferies traders have dubbed the “SaaSpocalypse.” Roughly $1 trillion in software market value was wiped out in seven trading days in early February 2026. The S&amp;P North American Software Index posted a 15% decline in January — its worst month since October 2008. ServiceNow beat every Q4 metric and still dropped 28% year-to-date. Asana has fallen 92% from its all-time high.</p><p>The valuation compression has been severe and sustained. The BVP Nasdaq Emerging Cloud Index median revenue multiple peaked at 18.4x in September 2021 and has compressed to roughly 6x. Private SaaS M&amp;A multiples fell from 6.7x EV/Revenue in 2021 to 2.9x in 2024. This is not cyclical — it reflects a structural repricing driven by the genuine threat that AI agents will replace the seat-based pricing model that underpins most enterprise software.</p><p>The trigger was specific. Satya Nadella declared “SaaS is dead” on the BG2 podcast in December 2024, arguing that business applications are “essentially CRUD databases” whose logic will migrate to the AI tier. Then Anthropic launched Claude Cowork plugins on January 30, 2026 — 11 plugins covering legal, sales, and finance tasks that directly compete with vertical SaaS products. Of the $1 trillion wiped out in the broader SaaS selloff, $285 billion vanished in a single session on February 4 as the market digested Cowork’s implications. Thomson Reuters dropped 18%. RELX fell 14%. IDC predicts that by 2028, pure seat-based pricing will be obsolete, with 70% of software vendors refactoring pricing around consumption, outcomes, or organizational capability.</p><p>This creates a paradox — or what looks like one. Mc Kinsey’s Amit Arya has argued that the SaaS selloff and the infrastructure buildout rely on mutually exclusive scenarios: either AI is so transformative that it destroys established software workflows (justifying the infrastructure spend but not the SaaS crash), or AI underdelivers (making the buildout a bubble but the SaaS selloff overdone). Both cannot be true simultaneously. But Arya’s framing assumes a two-player game: either AI works and the builders win, or it doesn’t and SaaS survives. There is a third possibility — the one that 160 years of infrastructure history keeps producing. AI works. SaaS gets destroyed. And the hyperscalers don’t capture the value either, because it flows to the startups, the users, the 20-year-old with the API key. All three happen simultaneously. The hyperscalers are locked in a classic prisoner’s dilemma — each must spend or fall behind, so collectively they drive down the cost of the very infrastructure they’re trying to monetize. The value leaks to players who never had to ante up.</p><h2>The innovator’s dilemma eating the builders from inside</h2><p>Three of the five companies spending the most on AI infrastructure — Microsoft, Google, and Oracle — are themselves massive enterprise software businesses. Microsoft 365 generates over $60 billion in annual revenue. Google Workspace serves over 10 million businesses. Oracle’s database and ERP empire is the foundation of its $57 billion revenue base. These are precisely the businesses that AI agents threaten to cannibalize.</p><p>Consider Microsoft Copilot. The underlying models are extraordinary. Yet the product integration into Office 365 has been, by any honest assessment, a disaster. Microsoft disclosed roughly 15 million paid Copilot seats in early 2026 — about 3.3% of its 450 million commercial Microsoft 365 users. Microsoft slashed internal sales targets by up to 50%. Even Nadella reportedly sent frustrated emails to engineering managers, admitting that Copilot’s Outlook integrations “for the most part don’t really work” and are “not smart.” I’ve used Copilot extensively. Nadella is being generous.</p><p>Is this execution failure or strategic restraint? There is a disquieting possibility. The copilot-style integrations feel disappointing because making them truly great would destroy the product they’re embedded in. If Copilot could genuinely replace the need for ten Salesforce seats with one AI agent — as Nadella’s own “SaaS is dead” logic implies — then why would enterprises need ten Office 365 seats? A truly brilliant AI assistant in Office 365 wouldn’t sell more licenses. It would sell fewer. The models rock. The integrations feel lobotomized. Maybe that’s not a bug.</p><p>Google faces the same bind with Workspace — they bundled Gemini into every subscription in January 2025 rather than charging $30/month extra, because users were already going to ChatGPT and Claude for the actual work. A class-action lawsuit was filed alleging Google “secretly” enabled Gemini within Workspace apps without consent. The AI was opt-out, buried, and intrusive, yet somehow also underwhelming.</p><p>Oracle has it worst: its $50 billion capex bet, crushing debt, $248 billion in off-balance-sheet lease commitments — to host other people’s AI workloads while also selling the database and ERP software that agents will eventually bypass entirely. That’s not a strategy. That’s a hostage situation with yourself.</p><p>Amazon’s version is even more absurd. The company has invested billions in Anthropic and sells Claude Code to customers through AWS Bedrock — but won’t let its own engineers use it for production work, steering them instead toward Kiro, an in-house tool that 1,500 Amazon employees have petitioned to replace. As one engineer put it internally: Kiro’s “only survival mechanism becomes forced adoption rather than genuine value.” Amazon is paying to fund the product it won’t let its own people use.</p><h2>Anthropic is going up the stack</h2><p>While the incumbents are trapped, a company with no legacy software revenue is moving at a speed that should alarm every enterprise software CEO. Claude Code hit $1 billion in annualized run-rate revenue less than a year after launch — a pace that rivals GitHub Copilot’s trajectory and may be the fastest ramp for a developer product ever. Then came Cowork, built by Anthropic’s own engineers in roughly a week and a half using Claude Code itself, extending AI capabilities from coding to knowledge work.</p><p>The Cowork plugins launched January 30 weren’t a minor product update. HubSpot cratered 39% year-to-date, Figma 40%, Atlassian 35%. Indian IT services companies lost roughly $23 billion in a single session as investors realized billable-hour models are existentially threatened.</p><p>These weren’t generic AI tools — they were specialized vertical replacements. Unlike the “copilots” of 2024 and 2025, Claude Cowork uses the Model Context Protocol to gain direct, permissioned access to a user’s local file system, browser, and enterprise databases. The legal plugin doesn’t just draft a document — it triages NDAs against a firm’s internal playbook, flags non-compliant clauses, and independently researches case law. The logic is death by a thousand plugins: every vertical SaaS company now competes not with another startup, but with an open-source extension to a frontier AI model. Then, days later, Anthropic released Opus 4.6 with a million-token context window.</p><p>The company signed a term sheet for $10 billion in funding at a $350 billion valuation. It has over 300,000 business customers. Anthropic is doing what Microsoft, Google, and Oracle cannot politically do to themselves: building AI products that treat existing enterprise software as data repositories rather than the centers of work. But the Cowork plugins are weeks old, not battle-tested in regulated environments, and the gap between a demo that impresses and a product that a bank’s risk committee will actually approve is where most enterprise software ambitions go to die. Revenue is growing faster than any startup has a right to expect. Whether it converts into durable enterprise relationships or remains a developer enthusiasm story is an open question that $350 billion in valuation does not leave much room to get wrong.</p><h2>The $0 marginal employee</h2><p>While the giants agonize, something else is happening that neither the hyperscalers nor the SaaS incumbents can control: the cost of building a software company is collapsing to near zero.</p><p>Inference costs have declined 99.7% in two years. DeepSeek’s R1 delivered comparable performance at roughly 96% lower cost than frontier API pricing. Open-source models — Llama, Mistral, Qwen, DeepSeek, Arcee AI — are exerting relentless downward pressure on API pricing. New silicon (Google’s TPUs, Amazon’s Trainium, AMD’s GPUs) is fragmenting Nvidia’s near-monopoly. The logical endpoint is that inference becomes a commodity like bandwidth, which is exactly what happened to telecom. I now routinely see open-weight models match frontier performance on real-world tasks. The floor keeps rising, and the ceiling keeps falling.</p><p>But inference cost is only one input. The real revolution is that every cost of building a company is collapsing simultaneously. Claude Code means one person can ship what used to require a ten-person engineering team. Agent swarms can run 24/7 customer support, content generation, lead qualification, and data analysis for the cost of API calls. The marginal cost of a startup is converging on a laptop and an API key.</p><p>This is the precise historical pattern, replaying in fast-forward. Zuckerberg was 19 when he built Facebook on fiber optic cables buried by companies that had already gone bankrupt. Bezos ran a bookstore on the same dirt-cheap connectivity. Google’s first data centers used commodity hardware in rented space. Every transformative company was built by people who arrived after the infrastructure was built and priced to move.</p><p>The AI equivalent is happening right now. Somewhere, a 20-year-old — or a tiny team of three — is running agent swarms on infrastructure that hyperscalers spent hundreds of billions to build. They’re paying a few hundred dollars a month for compute that would have cost millions five years ago. They don’t have departments — they have API calls. They are building a company with a thousand invisible employees, and their burn rate is whatever the inference bill is. I’ve met these founders. They’re not hypothetical. They’re shipping products that would have required 50-person teams two years ago, and they genuinely do not understand why anyone would hire a sales team in 2026.</p><p>The incumbents can’t do this. Microsoft can’t deploy a truly autonomous agent inside Office 365 without undermining per-seat licensing. Oracle can’t make its own database irrelevant. Amazon is firing tens of thousands of employees to fund the very infrastructure that makes these startups possible — and can’t prevent them from using it. The 20-year-old has no installed base, no revenue to protect, no board asking about cannibalization risk. They can build the product that<em>should</em>exist — the one the incumbents are too conflicted to ship.</p><h2>The market is starting to blink</h2><p>For two years, investors tolerated escalating AI capex because revenue growth in cloud and AI services was accelerating alongside it. That patience is running out.</p><p>No one embodies the contradictions of this moment better than Andy Jassy. Since taking over as Amazon CEO, Jassy has eliminated a cumulative 57,000 corporate positions — 27,000 in 2022–2023, and 30,000 more since October 2025, the largest workforce reduction in the company’s 31-year history. He told analysts the layoffs were “not really financially driven, and it’s not even really AI-driven, not right now. It’s culture.” Then, in a June 2025 memo to all employees, he wrote: “We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today.” The same quarter, he guided for $200 billion in 2026 capex — against a consensus of $146.6 billion — the largest single-year capital expenditure in corporate history. He is firing humans and hiring data centers at a pace no CEO in history has attempted simultaneously.</p><p>Amazon’s Q4 earnings beat on revenue ($213.4 billion vs. $211.3 billion expected) and showed AWS growing at its fastest rate in 13 quarters. None of it mattered. The stock plunged 8–10% on the capex number alone. Morgan Stanley now projects Amazon’s free cash flow will turn negative $17 billion in 2026; Bank of America’s estimate is worse: negative $28 billion. The very next day, Amazon filed an S-3 shelf registration with the SEC — pre-positioning for a debt and equity raise. For a company that has historically generated enormous free cash flow and never needed external capital markets, analysts compared it to a confession. Jassy is betting that the 57,000 people he fired will cost less than the infrastructure that replaces them. He may be right. But if the capex doesn’t generate returns, he will have destroyed the workforce<em>and</em>the balance sheet.</p><p>Even Alphabet, which posted the strongest earnings of the group with Google Cloud revenue up 48% year-over-year to $17.7 billion, saw its stock sell off on the capex guidance.</p><p>Oracle is in deeper trouble. The stock has fallen more than 50% from its September 2025 peak — its worst performance since 2001. Total debt rose 40% year-over-year to $108 billion on just $30 billion in book value. Its credit default swap spread hit levels not seen since the 2009 financial crisis, on par with junk bonds despite a BBB rating. A bondholder class action alleges Oracle’s offering documents were “false and misleading.” Morgan Stanley slashed its price target and warned the company’s AI expansion leaves “little room for error.”</p><p>Barclays projects Meta will generate negative free cash flow in 2027 and 2028, a scenario the analysts themselves described as “somewhat shocking” but likely applicable to “all companies in the AI infrastructure arms race.” It gets worse: the Wall Street Journal reported on February 11 that Meta’s own auditor, EY, raised a red flag over the company’s data center accounting — specifically, the off-balance-sheet treatment of a $27 billion AI data center in Louisiana structured through a joint venture with Blue Owl Capital. The timing is notable: in January 2025, Amazon shortened server depreciation schedules citing AI obsolescence risk, while Meta extended them — opposite conclusions from companies facing identical technology cycles, saving Meta $2.9 billion in annual depreciation. When the auditor starts questioning how the capex is being booked, the telecom parallels stop being metaphorical.</p><p>The aggregate picture: $700 billion in capex, $400 billion in new debt, and a SaaS destruction event that threatens the builders’ own enterprise software revenues. The market has shifted, as Deutsche Bank’s Jim Reid observed, from “every tech stock is a winner” to “a true winners and losers landscape.”</p><p>Is the music about to stop? Not in the way the telecom bubble ended. The hyperscalers are too profitable in their core businesses for sudden bankruptcy. But something subtler is occurring: investors are repricing these companies from asset-light, high-ROIC growth stories into capital-intensive utilities — and utilities don’t trade at 25–30x earnings. The music doesn’t stop all at once. The tempo just keeps slowing until no one’s dancing.</p><h2>Where this leaves investors</h2><p>These are not recommendations — they are the archetypes of how serious investors are positioning.</p><p><strong>The case that the curse is broken.</strong>The bull case is that this time the builder keeps the house. If AI collapses the distinction between infrastructure and application — if the cloud provider becomes the product — then the builder’s curse doesn’t apply. Google has Gemini across all products, reaching 2 billion users. Amazon is both Anthropic’s largest investor and its largest customer. Microsoft has Copilot across the entire Office stack. The hyperscalers aren’t just laying railroad track; they’re trying to own the towns along the route. The 160-year pattern says that doesn’t work. But no prior infrastructure builder had billions of captive users to sell into.</p><p><strong>Picks-and-shovels.</strong>ASML holds a monopoly on EUV lithography. TSMC fabricates silicon for everyone. Vertiv, Eaton, and Schneider Electric sell cooling and power infrastructure every data center needs. Nuclear plays (Constellation, Cameco) benefit from insatiable power demand. This is the Levi Strauss strategy, and it’s working. The risk: every name is levered to the same capex cycle. If spending decelerates, they all crash in sympathy.</p><p><strong>Contrarian SaaS rebound.</strong>Some of the most hated stocks in tech are trading at 2015 valuations on 2026 revenue. The market is pricing in near-complete disruption — but Microsoft Copilot has converted just 3.3% of its addressable base after two years. At $30/seat/month, 97% of the addressable base remains unconverted. Only 6% of enterprises have moved AI past pilot, and Gartner predicts 40% of agentic AI projects will be canceled by end of 2027. The companies with proprietary data moats and brutal switching costs may be massively oversold. The risk: some of them<em>will</em>be the next Nortel.</p><p><strong>Hyperscaler rotation.</strong>Amazon/AWS has no enterprise software to protect — it collects the cloud bill regardless of which model or application wins. That’s structurally the cleanest hand, which is exactly why the market is repricing it as a utility: at 29 times earnings, a 72% discount to its ten-year average, Jassy’s $200 billion bet is already being valued like infrastructure, not tech. It’s a different position from Microsoft, which must navigate between being the world’s largest infrastructure builder and the world’s largest enterprise software company while watching OpenAI undermine Office. Google’s version may be worse: Search is 57% of revenue, and every AI answer delivered directly is an ad click that never happens. It’s spending $75 billion a year to build the technology that teaches users they don’t need Google. Oracle looks like the weakest hand: most leveraged, most concentrated in a single customer, most vulnerable to both the debt cycle and the SaaS destruction it’s enabling.</p><p><strong>Buy gold and wait.</strong>The true bear case. If AI-related revenue never catches up to the capex required to generate it, the hyperscalers’ core businesses are being disrupted by the AI they’re building, and $400 billion in bond issuance creates systemic risk — the unwind could be severe. Oracle’s credit spreads already flashing distress signals are a leading indicator. The historical precedent: the best assets to own after an infrastructure bubble bursts are the infrastructure assets themselves, purchased for pennies on the dollar from distressed sellers.</p><p>None of these trades is obviously right. What history<em>does</em>resolve: the real alpha is almost certainly not in any of these. It’s in finding — or being — the 20-year-old building the next Google on infrastructure that gets cheaper every day.</p><h2>The builder’s curse meets its strongest test</h2><p>The pattern across 160 years of American infrastructure investment is unambiguous: builders create enormous social value but capture very little of it. Railroads generated a 43% social return but kept only 8%. Telecom companies invested $500 billion and destroyed $2.8 trillion in equity, while the companies built on that cheap bandwidth — Google, Netflix, Amazon, Facebook — now command combined market caps exceeding $7 trillion.</p><p>The AI buildout is testing this pattern against the strongest — but also the most internally conflicted — set of infrastructure builders in economic history. They have profitable core businesses and investment-grade credit ratings. But they also have something no prior infrastructure builder had: legacy businesses that the infrastructure they’re building may destroy. And they face something no prior builder faced: AI-native insurgents moving up the stack at terrifying speed, unencumbered by the innovator’s dilemma.</p><p>The revenue gap between AI spending and AI revenue is alarming. The depreciation dynamics are uniquely punishing: AI chips have 3–5 year useful lives versus 30+ years for railroad track or fiber optic cable, meaning perpetual reinvestment rather than one-time construction. And the spread between what it costs to build and what it costs to use is widening every month — that’s the builder’s curse in its purest form.</p><p>Clausewitz warned that every offensive contains the seeds of its own culmination — the point where the attacker has advanced so far that the advantage shifts to the defender. The hyperscalers have pushed $700 billion past that point. They are building the infrastructure that makes any one of them replaceable, and all of them commodities.</p><p>Somewhere right now, a small team is building the next transformative company on AI infrastructure that cost trillions to create and pennies to access. They have no legacy revenue to protect, no century bond to service, no shareholders demanding they preserve yesterday’s margins. They have a laptop, an API key, and a thousand invisible AI employees.
