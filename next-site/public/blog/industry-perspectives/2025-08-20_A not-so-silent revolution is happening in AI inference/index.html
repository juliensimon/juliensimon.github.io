You’ll find numbers at the end of the post.</p><p id="0f32">Same model. Same chips. What happened? Llama.cpp is on fire, that’s what. New features, such as <a href="https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/pull/14363" target="_blank">splitting the KV cache across sequence decoding</a>, are delivering double-digit gains overnight.</p><p id="5add">Takeaways:</p><p id="55f6">➡️ If you’re been using GPU inference indiscriminately, it’s time to reconsider. Your existing CPU servers may be an extremely cost-effective option, and they can also run your app!</p><p id="0425">➡️ If you’re not rebuilding llama.cpp every day, you’re doing it wrong 😂</p><p id="58b2">➡️ We used to pick between ‘fast but less imprecise 4-bit’ vs ‘slow but more precise 8-bit’. That’s not so true anymore. 8-bit models are now fast enough (whatever that means to you) for many use cases.</p><p id="9170">➡️ The speedup on larger batch sizes definitely invalidates my long-standing advice of “CPU inference only really makes sense at batch size 1”. Now, I would consider larger batch sizes, especially for non-interactive workloads, and experiment to find the sweet spot between thread count, latency, and throughput.</p><p id="3d01">What truly puts a smile on my face is that these aren’t even the bleeding-edge CPUs. There’s much more speed coming.</p><p id="f739">And this story ends on laptops and devices for minimal latency, maximum cost optimization, and full privacy. Many of us know that already 😀</p><figure><div><img alt="" height="591" src="image01.webp" width="486"></div></figure><figure><div><img alt="" height="611" src="image02.webp" width="479"></div></figure></div></div></div></div></section></div></div></article>
